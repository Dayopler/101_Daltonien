How we want this filter to work now:

-Clic on icon "101"

-Choose your filter and clic on it

-the filter applies on your page

(Currently this is a Google Chrome-only extension.)



How we want this filter to work in the futur:

-Add a complete extension on your OS

(Because, right now Windows have just 2 or 3 settings)
